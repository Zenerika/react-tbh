# Tech Balanced Home (React Web App, Future React Native App)

[__TBH__](http://www.techbalancedhome.com) is a web app that I'm currently working on using React-Redux. I'm planning on refactoring TBH in the near future using React Native and launching it as a mobile app.  

This was the capstone project for my coding bootcamp, [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Houston. [Project Requirements](https://github.com/oakmac/flex-class-capstone-project-requirements):

>Your project must be a full stack application.
* It must contain code that runs on the server (Node.js)
* And the browser (client-side JavaScript)
* You must use a database to store and retrieve data.
* Your project must be deployed somewhere publicly accessible.
* You must use at least one AJAX request to communicate to a back end API endpoint.
* The visual design of your application must be cohesive.
* No "spaghetti code"
