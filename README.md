# Tech Balanced Home

[__TBH__](http://www.techbalancedhome.com) is a web app that I'm currently working on using React-Redux. I'm planning on refactoring TBH in the near future using React Native and launching it as a mobile app.  

This was the capstone project for my coding bootcamp, [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Houston.

> [Project Requirements](https://github.com/oakmac/flex-class-capstone-project-requirements):
* It must contain code that runs on the server (Node.js)
* And the browser (client-side JavaScript)
* You must use a database to store and retrieve data.
* Your project must be deployed somewhere publicly accessible.
* You must use at least one AJAX request to communicate to a back end API endpoint.
* The visual design of your application must be cohesive.
* No "spaghetti code"

## Tech Used (MERN)
This app used the following technologies:
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io)

## Project Management
I created a flowchart to understand the project scope and then I continued creating updated to-do lists while prioritizing my //todos.
